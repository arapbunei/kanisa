    <h2>The Sabbath in Colossians 2</h2>
    <section class="secOne">
      <p>More Adventists keep the seventh-day Sabbath than does any other group on earth, including Jews. So when people are taking a hard look at the Sabbath, it’s important that we provide clear biblical teaching.</p>
      <p>One passage that has always been important to Adventists is Colossians 2:16, 17: “Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day. These are a shadow
        of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.”</p>
      <p>Some see this passage as a challenge to the perpetuity of the seventh-day Sabbath, grouping it with Jewish feasts and new moons—and terming them all as “shadows.” </p>
      <p>Is the weekly Sabbath in play here ? And if so, has it been relegated to “shadow” status?</p>
      <p>The <em>Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary </em>says: “The type of sabbath under consideration is shown by the phrase ‘which are a shadow of things to come’ (Col. 2:17, KJV). The weekly Sabbath is a memorial of an event at the beginning of earth’s
        history. . . . Hence, the ‘sabbath days’ Paul declares to be shadows pointing to Christ cannot refer to the weekly Sabbath designated by the fourth commandment, but must indicate the ceremonial rest days that reach their realization in Christ
        and His kingdom” (vol. 7, pp. 205, 206). The difficulty with this explanation is that it’s circular; it rules out the Sabbath based on our own understanding of the Sabbath. That isn’t good enough. If the New Testament declares the Sabbath to be
        a shadow, we must be open to that.</p>
      <p>Adventist theologian Ron du Preez, in his book <em>Judging the Sabbath</em>, makes a much stronger case that “sabbath days” in this passage are, in fact, ceremonial days. Citing the chiastic structure used by Hebrew writers, Du Preez points to Hosea
        2:11, which he says partitions the annual Jewish festivals into two categories: “feast days” and “sabbaths” (KJV).</p>
      <p>If, for the sake of argument, the weekly Sabbath was in view here, does that mean it’s been fulfilled along with the feasts and new moons? Not necessarily. Whenever we find the sequence of feasts, new moons, and sabbaths in the Old Testament, it’s
        almost always within one particular context: sacrifices. Ezekiel 45:17, for example, says: “It will be the duty of the prince to provide the burnt offerings, grain offerings and drink offerings at the festivals, the New Moons and the Sabbaths—at
        all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel.” This passage, and others like it, use the same key terms as Colossians 2: meat, drink, feasts, new moons, sabbaths. The context is <em>sacrifices</em>.</p>
      <p>So what could Paul mean by “shadow” in Colossians 2:17? Most scholars argue that the shadows are the feasts, new moons, and sabbaths. But a new moon can’t be a “shadow,” because a new moon had no religious significance in itself. A new moon’s only
        significance was its association with sacrifices. Instead, the shadow must have something to do with what all these particular days had in common: the sacrifices<em> offered</em> on them.</p>
      <p>Is there support for the idea that “shadow” refers to sacrifices? Yes. The two other New Testament references to shadows are found in Hebrews. “There are already men who offer the gifts prescribed by the law. They serve at a sanctuary that is a
        copy and shadow of what is in heaven” (Heb. 8:4, 5). And, “The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming—not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make
        perfect those who draw near to worship. . . . Therefore, when Christ came into the world he said, ‘Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me’” (Heb. 10:1-5).</p>
      <p>At a time when sacrifices were still being offered in Jerusalem (even by early Christians), Paul taught that the age of sacrifices was over. They were shadows of something better to come: the body of Christ, for which the weekly Sabbath remains
        an enduring symbol of our salvation—rest in Him.</p>

    <h2>Escaping Shipwreck Of The Home</h2>
    <section class="secTwo">
      <p>This is a special tempatation to young people and, thus we need to clearly understand how we can avoid this,because a shipwrecked home can lead to the most unhappiness in this world and in many cases, to shipwreck of eternity. </p>
      <p>Paul's shipwreck experience as recorded in Acts 27, has a great deal of information for us as we are studying this subject.</p>
      <p>We read in this passage that the time for sailing had past. Consequently paul was admonishing the shipmaster that the voyage was going to be disastrous. He counseled him not to go, and he warned that a voyage would result in disaster, not only to
        the ship and cargo, but also to life. But the captain did not listen.</p>
      <p>After all , Paul was a prisoner trying to tell the captain what he should do. The chain of command doesn not generally work that way! Normally, prisoners do not tell captain's what to do, but Paul was a unique prisoner.</p>
      <p>This prisoner, this messenger from God gave instruction not to sail, because doing so would result in a shipwreck. What happened, the captain ignored the messenger from God and sailed, and they were shipwrecked.</p>
      <p>The same reasons for which the centurion rejected God's messenger are used today. The worldly counselors say it is a good thing to do, or it is more convenient or more comfortable to not follow what God's messenger has revealed to us.</p>
      <p>Or they say that everybody is doing it so it cannot be that bad, but if everybody shipwrecks, do you want to shipwreck too? No, the only safety for us as young people to escape shipwreck in our home is to follow implicitly what God has revealed
        to us through His messenger's, through the bible, and through the spirit of prophecy. Consider the following points as to when it is safe to enter into a relationship.</p>
      <h2>know the creator</h2>
      <p>From Genesis 2:21, 22 we learn that, God first made Adam. God could have made Adam and Eve together; it would have no problem. He spoke, and all animals came forth; all the plants came forth; but He did not make Adam and Eve together.</p>
      <p>Adam was made first so he could become acquianted with God. God wanted Adam to develop a relationship with Him first.</p>
      <p>It is feasible that if God had made them both together, instead of developing a relationship with their creator, their eyes would have locked on each other, and then they would not have had that relationship with their creator.</p>
      <p>Again God could have made Eve without putting Adam to sleep. He could have just formed the dust of the ground and breathed into Eve, and there Adam's mate would have been. I believe that God put Adam to sleep so that Eve could develop a relationship
        with her creator before she did with Adam.</p>
      <p>We must, before we contemplate on earthly relationship, have a relationship with our creator.Any thing else is in danger of leading us to shipwreck in our homes,which frequently results in shipwreck of eternity.Both individuals need to have a relationship
        with their creator before they are prepared for a relationship with each other.</p>

      <h2>Life Work</h2>
      <p>Genesis 2: 15, 19, 20. This account is very instructive. Here we find that Adam was created, but he was not just introduced to his creator the given Eve. God first gave to Adam a way to live. He gave him his lifework before he gave him his life
        companion. We need to know and be prepared for our lifework before we enter into relationship. By the way Adam could prepare for his lifework better if he was not thinking about Eve. So often young people begin to prepare for their lifework, but
        instead they are developing an interest in someone, and that takes all their time. The relationship detracts from what their preparation needs to be.</p>

      <h2>Financial Responsibilty</h2>
      <p>From 1 Timothy 5:8 We learn that if we do not provide for our own, we have denied the faith and are worse than an infidel! So is it wise a very wise thing to get married if we have no way of supporting a family?</p>
      <p>Financial stresses are ranked as one of the highest causes of divorce. I am not saying we should own our business or have to own a house, but we need to have some way to support a family.</p>

      <h2>Godly Counselors</h2>
      <p>A very difficult story for us in this day and age in which we live is given in Genesis 24. Abraham was arranging for the marriage of his 40-year old son Isaac.If we were 40,would we think that our parents would have the right to direct so intimately
        in our affairs? But Isaac trusted his fathers judgement.Isaac listened to godly counselors.Our parents, if they are in the lord are the best counselors we have.</p>
      <p>Counselors are important because love is blind.It is very hard when someone counsels against what the heart wants. But we need to seek advice from godly counselors, even if we are 40 years old.</p>

      <h2>Poor Judge</h2>
      <p>God's messenger, Ellen White stated:"A youth not out of his teens is a poor judge of the fitness of a person as young as himself to be his companion for life." messeges to young people, 452.</p>
      <p>As we grow and mature, we change. Many people, when they marry young start separating as they mature and change, resulting in a shipwrecked home. That is why the Lord gave us this counsel.</p>

      <h2>Allow God To Lead</h2>
      <p>"And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof; And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man.And Adam
        said, This [is] now bone of my bones, and flesh: she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man." Genesis 2:21-23.</p>
      <p>Does it appear as though Adam was searching under every leaf in the garden to try to find a mate? No, Adam allowed God to lead. We must allow God to lead. It is not safe to enter into a relationship unless both persons involved know that God is
        leading. Adam and Eve knew that God was leading.</p>

      <h2>Passed By</h2>
      <p>Oh but we may think that we are going to get passed by. God does not withhold any good thing from us, and the Lord promises that if we commit our ways to Him, He will give us the desires of our heart. (psalm 84:11; 37:4.) E.G White wrote "Marriage
        is something that will influence and affect your life both in this life and in the world to come. A sincere christian will not advance in this direction without knowing the knowledge that God approves his course. He will not want to choose for
        himself, but will feel that God must choose for him." The adventist Home, 43.</p>
      <p>We need to come to that point of total and complete surrender and say , "Lord , i do not want to choose; that decision is too big for me." When we come to that point of complete surrender, God can work, and God can lead.</p>
      <p>May we each follow the principles God has given to us, that we might escape the shipwreck, that we might have a sure and solid anchor.</p>

          at a very tender age, often by polygamous men old enough to be their grandparents. A 2 year old boy no longer stays with her mother and is supposed to be sleeping outside the house with the grown up boys all in the name of providing security
          for their ladies. All this coupled with unemployment, lack of formal education, high child mortality rate, malnourishment as lactating mothers can not even breast feed due to lack of breast milk, their only diet is milk and meat, no greens no
          fruits and despite all this they still manage to travel long distance in search of a church. Kindly say a word of prayer for them. </p>
