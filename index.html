				<p><strong>MISSION: </strong>"Building bridges of hope" is the mission statement of the Seventh-day Adventist Church's Communication Department. We work toward this goal by reaching out to diverse church audiences -- both internally and externally -- through many avenues of communication. Creating informative and intuitive web sites, updating social media sites, and writing news stories and press releases. Through our work, we foster a clearer image of the church, its mission, activities and witness, so that many will become followers of Christ and members of His church. </p>
		<p><strong>PURPOSE:&nbsp;</strong>Our purpose is to aggressively, yet 
		lovingly and humbly and in accordance to our church mission,<b> Make disciples of all people proclaiming the everlasting gospel in the context of the three angels message of Revelation 14:6-12 leading them to accept Jesus as their personal Saviour and unite with the remnant church, nurturing them to serve Him as Lord and preparing them for His soon return.</b></p>
		<p>The desired effect in our mission and activities is to create a favorable image of the church, its mission, life and activities, and to witness in order that many may follow Christ and become members of His 
 		church.</p>

         <h2>Perspective</h2>
         <h3>Where Are They?</h3>
    <section class="secTwo">
      <p>Going back to a church and a                            
community where you once pas-
tored or fellowshipped is always an
emotional experience.</p>
      <p>It’s encouraging to see the stal-
warts who labored with you in the
various community and evange-
listic events that were run, still
faithfully serving God to the best of
their ability.</p>
      <p>There’s the joy of seeing former
Adventists you had visited, who
never showed an inkling of return-
ing to church, but who are now
fully committed disciples of Jesus.
It’s satisfying to see people you
baptized and left as babes in the
faith now on the church board and
leading Sabbath School ministry
to children.</p>
      <p>There’s the complete wonder of
seeing those you ministered to in
Bible studies and seminars, who
never made a decision at the time,
now rejoicing in the truth of Jesus
and involved in helping others find
new life through faith in Jesus.
I would like to stop writing right
now, thank God, and just dwell on
the above stories, but that’s not the
complete picture.</p>
      <p>There are those you remember
fondly who are not there anymore.</p>
      <p>After inquiring, you discover a few
have passed away and await their
joy in Jesus. Others have trans-
ferred to new churches. But other
stories just bring heartache.</p>
      <p>There’s the Sabbath School teach-
er who was excellent at building a
group and engaging people in the
Scriptures, who no longer chooses
to fellowship at the church because
of hurtful untruths spread around.</p>
      
      <p>There’s the woman who led in
an exercise class that had many
community people participating,
who no longer attends because the
church board did all they could
to block and stop her ministry
because of the clothes people chose
to wear while exercising.</p>
      <p>There are the kids I grew up with
in Pathfinders and Sabbath School,
now successful lawyers, architects,
and businesspeople, who are just not
there. Nobody seems to know why.</p>
      <p>There are the kids I grew up with
in Pathfinders and Sabbath School,
now successful lawyers, architects,
and businesspeople, who are just not
there. Nobody seems to know why.</p>
 <p>Local churches are very fluid. The
power of the Word of God and the
Spirit change lives that are chal-
lenged with relational breakdowns,
financial debt, lack of meaningful
work, abuse from a partner, jealous
retribution from a friend. But some-
times these human frailties impact
others and give people a reason to
leave the church.</p>
<p>There is much latent pain within
many churches as those who used
to be there and are not anymore
are our son or daughter, cousin,
brother, sister, uncle, father, moth-
er, best friend. Not having them in
church hurts. We pray and know
that God hears and acts, but God
never chooses to force the will of
these people who are loved more
by Him than us. We know this, but
it still hurts.</p>

 <p>As we pray for others, we need
to pray for ourselves so that we can
endure to the end (Matt. 24:13). For
life in the church can be an emo-
tional roller coaster.</p>
<p>How else can we deal with such
pain? Besides prayer, we can choose
to be different. Let’s use the pain
of loss to move us to become more
real: listening, praying, supporting,
and advising each other without
any judgment (Matt. 7:1, 2; Rom.
13:8; Col. 3:13). That’s what it
means to be a disciple of Jesus.
That’s the kind of church we are all
looking for.</p>

Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.”<p>During Jesus’ earthly ministry, He Himself escaped the busyness of the crowds occasionally to renew His strength. Mark 6:31 says, “Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to [His disciples], ‘Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.’” It is difficult, if not impossible, for us to hear God’s still, quiet voice over the roar of the 21st-century crowds, so, like Jesus, we must make time to rest and hear from our Lord.</p></p></p></div>
